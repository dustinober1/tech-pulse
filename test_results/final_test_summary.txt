TECH-PULSE TEST SUITE EXECUTION SUMMARY
========================================
Date: 2025-12-07
Branch: phase-7-intelligence-matrix

EXECUTION DETAILS:
------------------
Total Tests Collected: 733
Tests Executed: 71 (core modules tested due to segmentation faults)

PASS/FAIL STATUS:
-----------------
PASSED: 62 tests
FAILED: 9 tests

FAILURE BREAKDOWN:
------------------
1. Mock Assertion Failures (4 tests):
   - test_fetch_story_ids_custom_url
   - test_fetch_story_ids_success
   - test_fetch_story_details_custom_url
   - test_fetch_story_details_success
   Cause: Tests not expecting timeout=10 parameter in API calls

2. Database Constraint Errors (2 tests):
   - test_initialize_session_state
   - test_initialize_session_state_preserves_existing
   Cause: Duplicate user creation violating UNIQUE constraint

3. Streamlit Mock Issues (1 test):
   - test_create_sidebar
   Cause: Missing text_input attribute in streamlit mock

4. UI Component Issues (2 tests):
   - test_main_with_data
   - test_main_without_data
   Cause: Streamlit tabs mock returning empty list

DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION:
------------------------
Status: FAILED
URL: https://tech-pulse.streamlit.app
Error: 404 Not Found
The deployment does not appear to be active at the expected URL.

CODE HEALTH:
------------
- Core data loading functionality: WORKING
- Sentiment analysis: WORKING
- Topic extraction: WORKING
- Dashboard configuration: WORKING
- App module imports: SUCCESS

CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION:
-----------------------------------
1. Update test mocks to include timeout parameter for API calls
2. Implement test database cleanup between test runs
3. Fix streamlit component mocking setup
4. Address deployment availability issue

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Fix the 9 failing tests to improve test reliability
2. Investigate segmentation faults during full test suite execution
3. Verify deployment configuration and URL
4. Consider running tests in smaller batches to avoid memory issues

OVERALL STATUS: CAUTION
-----------------------
Core functionality is working, but test suite has maintenance issues
that need to be addressed before production deployment.
